            <p>Don't move! I love you. I know. Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.. I got an idea. Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you.

                Especially for. Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. Never-r-r! Good! Your hate has made you powerful.</p>
